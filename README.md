Well this is the README for getting started in this project and what I used to get going.

IDE setup:

I'll also be downloading the latest release of the Android SDK. That can be found here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
It's about 400MB make sure in a spot that can download something that size.

You'll want to run the Eclipse that is in the eclipse foldeer of the SDK that yo udownloaded.


Getting the project repository:

In Eclipse you'll want click the new button on the left of the toolbar. And select Android Application Project

make sure to call the application name "Capstone" this will automatically connect it to the folder that you should have pulled by now.

Everything else you can leave as the defaults.

I've posted a .gitignore I think it belongs in the repo/Capstone folder I might be wrong about that. I'm just thinking that it is probably important to not push .class files or other build files.
